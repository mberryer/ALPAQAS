# ALPAQAS
CellProfiler scripts for quantification of synaptic parameters

What is ALPAQAS?
ALPAQAS stands for Automated Layered Profiling And Quantitative Analysis of Synaptogenesis. 

How does ALPAQAS work?
ALPAQAS requires the open-source CellProfiler 3.1.5 software (www.cellprofiler.org).

What is the goal of ALPAQAS?
ALPAQAS quantifies synaptic parameters such as the area and the number of synaptic puncta, neurites and neuronal nuclei and exports them to a *.csv file.
